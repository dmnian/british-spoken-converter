# Assumptions and business logic

In british english time can be described in couple ways, but some are more common than the others, I focussed on most common ways.
For example, we can say: six minutes past five / five oh six (to describe 5:06)

Five oh six is more common, general rules behind that are described below:

- when it's from 1 to 9 minutes past the hour, we're using the sound 'oh' to represent zero
- we tend to use 'to' or 'past' with minutes that are multiples of five ('10 to six', '20 to seven', '25 past eight')
- instead 15 minutes we say 'quarter to', or 'quarter past'
- 30 minutes usually are described as 'half past'
